# Sentiment Classification - of IMDb User Reviews - using LSTM
An end-to-end toolkit on building a movie review sentiment classification LSTM model in Keras Deep Learning and the deploying model h5 file on local machine using Flask. Model is trained on IMDb Movie reviews [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

As part of model training, we have trained three separate nodels, namely: Simple Neural Net, CNN and LSTM; and concluded with reasoning as to why LSTMs are well suited to handle (sequential) text data.
